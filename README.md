# Solidity: Simple Smart_Contracts

  # 1. "Double it or lose it" smart contract in solidity


  smart_contacts/PaiseDoubleScheme.sol
  Scheme: 

  Entering amount - 1 ether  //can make this amount anything

  When the 4th person enters the scheme, smart contract automatically executes

  winner function, and randomly chooses two people as winners and transfers doubles

  amount, rest don't recieve anything.

  After every winner reveal, the contract resets and schemeId goes up by 1.

  you can see all previous winners using schemeId.


  This contract is not live on any mainnet, it's just for fun.

# GetRichQuickScheme_Solidity
Lottery smart contract in solidity



Scheme: 

Entering amount - 1 ether  //can make this amount anything

When the 4th person enters the scheme, smart contract automatically executes

winner function, and randomly chooses two people as winners and transfers doubles

amount, rest don't recieve anything.

After every winner reveal, the contract resets and schemeId goes up by 1.

you can see all previous winners using schemeId.


This contract is not live on any mainnet, it's just for fun.
